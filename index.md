- I am Chief Intelligence and Analytics Officer at [NHS Lincolnshire Integrated Care Board](https://lincolnshire.icb.nhs.uk/) where I lead on data and analytics for understanding system performance and population health. I have been in the NHS since 2022, having previously been Head of of Business Intelligence at [Suffolk and north east Essex Integrated Care Board](https://suffolkandnortheastessex.icb.nhs.uk/).
- Before moving to the NHS, I worked a Data and Policy Consultant with [Open Data Services](https://opendataservices.coop/). I worked on data standard development, data analysis and policy initiatives around open data. I worked on open data standards for [beneficial ownership of companies](https://github.com/openownership/data-standard), [fibre infrastructure](https://github.com/Open-Telecoms-Data/open-fibre-data-standard) and [community services](https://github.com/openreferral/specification).
- From 2020-2022 I worked as a Senior Epidemiologist for [Norfolk County Council](https://www.norfolk.gov.uk/) Public Health. I primarily worked on Covid-19 surveillance and response, but was also involved in other areas of public health intelligence.
- From finishing my PhD 2012 until 2020, I held research fellowships then a lectureship in biology. Most of this time was spent in [Biological Sciences at the University of East Anglia](https://www.uea.ac.uk/web/about/school-of-biological-sciences), but I also held fellowships at the Universities of [Groningen](https://www.rug.nl/?lang=en) and [Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/).
